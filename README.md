# ChatBot
This is just a basic Chatbot using ChatterBot Python. I customized it for Bangla just to practice for myself.


## Installation
This package can be installed from PyPi by running:

```
pip install chatterbot
```
You will find the path of Chatterbot-corpus 
Python installation folder
```
Python > Lib > site-packages > chatterbot_corpus
```

## Notice to RUN
You have to use PyCharm to given bangla input, I tried some IDE those are failed to run bangla input that was given.
I didn't try another solution how to run bangla on other IDE,
it's not even working on Python Shell.
So just Install Pycharm
